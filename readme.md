---

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Dependencies

npm install
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Configure the Bot

## Database

The bot uses SQLite and will create `scam_reports.db` automatically with the required tables.

## Telegram Username to ID Resolver

Some Telegram usernames cannot be resolved to user IDs via the Bot API.  
This bot uses a Python script (`utils/get_telegram_id.py`) as a fallback.

**First-time setup:**

1. Run the resolver once to initialize the session:

   ```bash
   python utils/get_telegram_id.py <any_username>
   ```

   - You will be prompted for your phone number and login code.
   - This creates `session.txt` for future automatic lookups.

**Note:**  

- The bot will use this script automatically if it cannot resolve a username via the Bot API.

---

## Usage

Start the bot:

```bash
npm start
```

### Main Features

- `/start` - Begin report flow.
- `/lookup <username>` - Lookup scam reports by username.
- `/export` - Export all reports to CSV (admin only).
- `/blacklist <user_id> [reason]` - Blacklist a user from reporting (admin only).

Reports are reviewed in the review group and published to the main channel if accepted.  
Scammer usernames are resolved to Telegram IDs for reliable linking.
